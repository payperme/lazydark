# LAZYDARK

Simple script based on Python to dive into darkweb, i read in some Reddit post "_The darkweb is boring all the links are dead_" and maybe it has the reason. That i write this code. You only need a bunch of links in a text file, sorting line by line or a single URL, and the script will grab "_a href_" and "<title>" and other data and will save it into MongoDB database. Enjoy it!.
